 This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine), the server engine powered by Nuxt.
::

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseClient](/usage/composables/use-supabase-client) composable but is designed to be used in [server routes](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/server-routes/).

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseClient` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/libraries.ts]
import { serverSupabaseClient } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseClient(event)

  const { data } = await client.from('librairies').select()

  return { librairies: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const fetchLibrairy = async () => {
  const { librairies } = await $fetch('/api/librairies')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including your supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const { data: { librairies }} = await useFetch('/api/librairies', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})
```
